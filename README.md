### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Aime Santiago. I believe in alot of astrology. With that said, I am proud to say I am a Leo. I practice professional salsa dancing since the age of 13. I am currently studying Graphic Information Technology. I enjoy being creative in many different forms. Electronically (creating business cards) physically (making merchandise look appealing) or even on plain pen and paper (drawing, doodling,etc).
